# Prep\_Tester

**Prep\_Tester** is a Python-based tool to help with preparation and testing your knowlege This guide will walk you through the steps to run **Prep\_Tester** on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running **Prep\_Tester**, ensure that you have the following installed:

* **Python** (version >= 13.5)
* **pip** (Python package manager) to install dependencies.

If you're using a virtual environment (which is recommended), ensure you have `virtualenv` installed:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

## Steps to Run **Prep\_Tester**

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akash1512485/Prep_Tester.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning the repository, move into the project folder:

```bash
cd Prep_Tester
```

### 3. Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

If you prefer to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your global Python installation:

* Create a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

* Activate the virtual environment:

  * On **Windows**:

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * On **Mac/Linux**:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed using `pip`. This will install all packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Project

Now that everything is set up, you can run **Prep\_Tester** by executing the main Python file.

* If the main file is named `prep_tester.py`, you can run it like this:

  ```bash
  python prep_tester.py
  ```

### 6. Using Command-Line Arguments (Optional)

If your project accepts command-line arguments or flags, you can include them when running the script. For example:

```bash
python prep_tester.py --option1 value1 --option2 value2
```

Check the documentation or use the `--help` flag to see available options:

```bash
python prep_tester.py --help
```

### 7. \[Any Additional Configuration]

If your project requires any additional configuration files, API keys, or setup steps, include instructions here.

For example:

* Create a `.env` file for environment variables:

  ```bash
  TOUCH .env
  ```

* Add any required variables to `.env`:

  ```bash
  API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

* **Missing dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies were installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **Version issues**: Double-check that you're using the correct version of Python and that the virtual environment is activated.
* **Permission issues**: On some systems, you may need to run with `sudo` or check file/folder permissions.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to **Prep\_Tester**, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
